# üñºÔ∏è Intensity Transformation Operations on Images

This project explores fundamental intensity transformation techniques in digital image processing using Python and OpenCV. These transformations enhance image contrast and brightness, making them crucial in fields like medical imaging, satellite vision, and computer vision applications.

## üìå Project Overview

In this notebook, I implemented and visualized the following transformations:

    Logarithmic Transformation
    Enhances low-intensity pixels and compresses high-intensity ones.

    Gamma (Power-Law) Transformation
    Controls overall brightness of the image via gamma correction.

    Piecewise Linear Transformation
    Customizes contrast enhancement using linear segments.

Each method is demonstrated on sample grayscale images, and the effects are analyzed via visual output.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

    Python 3.x

    OpenCV (cv2)

    NumPy

    Matplotlib

    Jupyter Notebook

## üß™ Key Learning Outcomes

    Understanding of point processing techniques for image enhancement.

    Hands-on practice with intensity transformations.

    Visualization of the impact of different enhancement methods.

    Preprocessing techniques for downstream machine learning or vision tasks.
